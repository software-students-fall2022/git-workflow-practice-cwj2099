This is an article about game development

"Using ready-made solutions can significantly speed up and 
simplify the game development process compared to writing your engine from scratch. 
The main disadvantage of using ready-made engines is that 
you need to read a lot of documentation and understand the engineâ€™s interface."


LUCY KOCHARIAN'S COMMENT: This is an interesting read, because I never thought about how the game must work across all operating systems, and how each OS is a different set of SDK and interaction rules

- I thought this article was very interesting because it discusses a different aspect to programming than conventional programs that we code in school. Coding a gaming program seems to be much more complicated that other regular programs and require extra conditions to keep in mind. I would probably play them but not create them.
