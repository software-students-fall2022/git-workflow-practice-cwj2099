This is an article about game development

"Using ready-made solutions can significantly speed up and 
simplify the game development process compared to writing your engine from scratch. 
The main disadvantage of using ready-made engines is that 
you need to read a lot of documentation and understand the engine’s interface."

- I thought this article was very interesting because it discusses a different aspect to programming than conventional programs that we code in school. Coding a gaming program seems to be much more complicated that other regular programs and require extra conditions to keep in mind. I would probably play them but not create them.
